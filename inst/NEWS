--------------------------------------

    GC-content for each region is retrieved through BSgenome packages.
    o Added details regarding the number of genes returned by each algorithm
    when conducting combined analysis.

    organisms.

    count.type="gene".

    Solved with the usage of RSQLite, however, the process is a bit longer.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.1 (2014-10-31)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Support for pig genome (Sus scrofa, susScr3 in UCSC)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.15 (2014-12-22)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Minor code improvements
    
BUG FIXES

    o Introduced a (hopefully robust) fix for constant changes in Ensembl
    schema for human GRC37 (hg19). It increases annotation retrieval time
    though
    o Fixed problem when input counts are a data.frame and count.type in exon,
    introduced during package upgrades. Thanks to Ben Elsworth, Garvan
    Institute of Medical Research, Austria.
    o Replaced "==" with all.equal while checking if the sum of weights is one
    when meta.p="weight". Of course this is the correct way to compare. Thanks 
    to Ben Elsworth, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Syndey, Australia.
    o Fixed problem related to a bug in the current version of edgeR GLM and 
    the usage of ... in glmFit.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.2 (2014-12-30)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the argument exclude.list, to provide the possibility of excluding
    samples from any analysis, e.g. in the case where after a preliminary 
    metaseqr run, some samples are not of adequate quality. It is useful when
    a previous analysis is restored, so as not to repeat the construction of
    a gene model from exons for example.
    
BUG FIXES

    o None

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.21 (2015-01-09)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o None
    
BUG FIXES

    o Fixed small bug regarding annotation retrieval when directly using the
    get.annotation function for certain genomes (e.g. pig). Thanks to Rathi
    Ryan from Synthetic Genomics, Inc.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.0 (2015-03-05)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added support for both forward and reverse RNA-Seq library preparation
    protocol. Thanks to Ben Elsworth, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, 
    Syndey, Australia.
    o Added Reads per Gene Model length (rpgm) measurement, where gene model
    length is either the sum of exon lengths or the gene length (depending on
    count.type argument).
    
BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a problem caused by a bug in baySeq 2.0.50 code which caused an
    analysis based in baySeq to crash.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.12 (2015-05-15)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o None
    
BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a crashing problem when weight="pandora".
    o Fixed deprecation issues.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.0 (2015-05-27)
--------------------------------------

    o Added ability to export JSON for a few graphs to
    be used with Highcharts library for interactive 
    visualization.

BUG FIXES

    o None.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.1 (2015-07-27)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added one more output list member of the main pipeline (metaseqr)
    containing all the processed data in a way that can be easily used
    for further downstream analysis in R.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed broken dependency with removed CRAN package MADAM which was
    used for the Fisher p-value combination. The fix was done by copying
    the two required functions from the last MADAM archived version (1.2).
    o Fixed a bug in make.sample.list which rendered the function unusable
    (credits to Marina Adamou-Tzani).
