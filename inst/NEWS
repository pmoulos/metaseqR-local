ChangeLog for package metaseqR

changes in version 0.9.0 (2013-11-21)
added:
    - First release

changes in version 0.9.1 (2013-11-27)
added:
    - Permutation methods for combining p-values from multiple statistics
    - More interactive and compact report
fixed:
    - A bug in exon filters resulting in removing genes/transcripts with only 
    one exon
    - A serious bug in exon filters causing wrong genes to be filtered out under
    circumstances

changes in version 0.91.0 (2014-01-03)
added:
  - Functions to create simulated datasets
  - Functions to create false discovery and ROC curves
fixed:
    - A bug in p-value vector naming causing unordered p-values for limma and
    baySeq when combining methods
    - Smaller bug fixes

changes in version 0.92.0 (2014-01-25)
added:
    - Functions to estimate weights for combining p-values based on simulated
    datasets from real data
fixed:
    - Smaller bug fixes

changes in version 0.93.0 (2014-02-12)
added:
    - Support for Arabidopsis thaliana
    - Additional validation functions
fixed:
    - Bugs affecting multilevel factorial analysis (single factor, more than two
    conditions)
    - Smaller bug fixes

changes in version 0.99.0 (2014-02-21)
added:
    - Support for Pan troglodytes
    - Improved the simulator to i) simulate length bias and ii) better length
    selection
fixed:
    - Code changes to comply with Bioconductor's guidelines

changes in version 0.99.1 (2014-03-12)
added:
    - Ability to export counts table (raw and normalized) when reading from BAM
    files or just normalized otherwise
    - Valid examples for many functions
fixed:
  - More code and codestyle changes to comply with Bioconductor's guidelines

changes in version 0.99.2 (2014-03-14)
added:
    - Ability to display only the top x% of significant genes to avoid 
    excessively big reports
fixed:
    - More code and codestyle changes to comply with Bioconductor's guidelines

changes in version 0.99.3 (2014-03-17)
added:
    - Function to check and warn if a main metaseqr argument is invalid (may
    prevent crashes during run)
fixed:
    - Small bug fix in read2count function

changes in version 0.99.4 (2014-03-18)
added:
fixed:
    - Removed all <<- assignments
    - Changed the Depends of DESCRIPTION file to import less packages in the 
    main environment
    - Added qvalue package to Depends as there was a problem with NBPSeq

changes in version 0.99.5 (2014-03-31)
added:
    - Changed directory structure of the report to look more organized and pro
    - Added the ability to save and retrieve the gene model counts list (counts
    for each exon) in an .RData file to be reused in another analysis later, as
    summarizing genes is one of the most time-consuming parts.
fixed:
    - Minor problems with the report

changes in version 0.99.6 (2014-04-09)
added:
    - Example on how to estimate statistical test weights in the vignette
fixed:
    - Bug when exporting flags when gene or exon filters are NULL
