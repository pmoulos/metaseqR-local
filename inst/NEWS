    selection

BUG FIXES

    o Code changes to comply with Bioconductor's guidelines

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1 (2014-03-12)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Ability to export counts table (raw and normalized) when reading from BAM
    files or just normalized otherwise
    o Valid examples for many functions

BUG FIXES

  o More code and codestyle changes to comply with Bioconductor's guidelines

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2 (2014-03-14)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Ability to display only the top x% of significant genes to avoid 
    excessively big reports

BUG FIXES

    o More code and codestyle changes to comply with Bioconductor's guidelines

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3 (2014-03-17)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Function to check and warn if a main metaseqr argument is invalid (may
    prevent crashes during run)

BUG FIXES

    o Small bug fix in read2count function

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.4 (2014-03-18)
--------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Removed all <<- assignments
    o Changed the Depends of DESCRIPTION file to import less packages in the 
    main environment
    o Added qvalue package to Depends as there was a problem with NBPSeq

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.5 (2014-03-31)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Changed directory structure of the report to look more organized and pro
    o Added the ability to save and retrieve the gene model counts list (counts
    for each exon) in an .RData file to be reused in another analysis later, as
    summarizing genes is one of the most time-consuming parts.

BUG FIXES

    o Minor problems with the report

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.6 (2014-04-09)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Example on how to estimate statistical test weights in the vignette

BUG FIXES

    o Bug when exporting flags when gene or exon filters are NULL

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0 (2014-04-11)
--------------------------------------


NEW FEATURES

    o Function to calculate the F1-score (or harmonic mean of precision and
    recall)
    o Mature and tested enough to go from 0.x.y version to 1.0.0

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2 (2014-05-05)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Function to merge exons belonging to different isoforms to a set of
    "virtual" exons to help construct a single gene model with unique exons
    o Simplified the usage of read2count()

BUG FIXES

    o Major bug in "exon" mode that inflated the number of reads for certain 
    genes with many isoforms
    o Minor bug in argument checking, not allowing to not save the gene model in
    "exon" mode

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3 (2014-08-21)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the ability to retrieve annotation for genes/exons from UCSC or
    RefSeq through connection to UCSC Genome Browser public SQL database. The
    GC-content for each region is retrieved through BSgenome packages.
    o Added details regarding the number of genes returned by each algorithm
    when conducting combined analysis.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed minor bug with warning level logging.
    o Fixed problem occured with the change of biomaRt attributes for newer
    organisms.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4 (2014-09-03)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added support for hg38

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed more problems occured with the change of biomaRt attributes for 
    newer organisms.
    o Fixed bug causing report crash when no genes are passing FDR threshold in
    paired comparisons.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5 (2014-09-30)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Re-analysis based on saved gene models is now faster.
    o Added the ability to save time-consuming part of analyses also when 
    count.type="gene".

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed problem with RMySQL dependency when using annotation from UCSC.
    Solved with the usage of RSQLite, however, the process is a bit longer.
