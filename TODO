- Remove intersection and union from the combination methods as they are equivalent to minp and maxp (which are more statistically relevant!)
- Add EBSeq in statistics
- Make the filters, normalization and statistical list arguments evaluation functions check also argument values (e.g. numeric)
- Create interactive MA plots with highcharts
- Add diagnostic data tables (e.g. the results of dat2save from NOISeq or the RNA composition test results).
