- Standardize a way to export ALL genes, irrespective of filtering and zero counts when pcut=1 (of course if filtering applied, they do not have a p-value)
- Venn diagrams when meta-analysis is performed
- Add EBSeq in statistics
- Write evaluation functions for filters
- Write evaluation functions for normalization and statistical list arguments
- Study about efficiency of statistical algorithms and use it to make weights for the Whitlock method (e.g. Soneson and Delorenzi, 2013)
- Create interactive MA plots with highcharts
- Add diagnostic data tables (e.g. the results of dat2save from NOISeq or the RNA composition test results).
